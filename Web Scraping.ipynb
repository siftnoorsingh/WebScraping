    "As a part of my current job, I had to migrate data from a HTML page to a different format and it contained 112 rows with 9 different components that had to be extracted from each row. So I decided that this would be an excellent opportunity to learn web page crawling and use it to get the job done. I used Beautiful Soup library for parsing the HTML tags and their content and the library is quite easy to use and extensive. And I also utilised Pandas library for saving the data in a dataframe for further preprocessing as you will see later in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is a severe lack of good tutorials on Web crawling(Most of them only cover the basics and simple pages), I had to rely solely on Beautiful Soup's documentation (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). Luckily, the documentation is quite user friendly and easy to understand nad I was able to learn the library on the go as well as finish the script in a matter of a few hours. So here goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the page will eventually be taken down from the server after the migration, I have added the original HTML page to the repository as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: I am fairly new to pandas and Beautiful Soup library so a lot of things done in this notebook may not necessarily be the definitive way to do things. Any feedback is welcome. And the data I am using for this is available publicly on a website so there is no breach of privacy in any way."
